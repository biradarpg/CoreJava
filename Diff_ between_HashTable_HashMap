

There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java:
1.	Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better 
	for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better 
	than synchronized ones.
2.	Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and 
	any number of null values.
3.	HashTable is Thread Safe  where as HashMap is not thread safe
4. HashTable is fail-safe where as HashTable is Fail-fast
5. Hashtable is synchronized whereas HashMap is non synchronized.
	[Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash table at one point of time.]






One of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd 
	want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), y
	ou could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap. 
	This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable.
